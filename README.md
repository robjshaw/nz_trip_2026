# NZ Weekend Fare Tracking – Jan–Feb 2026

## Overview
This repository contains **daily Markdown reports** tracking the lowest available round-trip fares for **Sydney (SYD) ⇄ Christchurch (CHC)** and **Sydney (SYD) ⇄ Queenstown (ZQN)** across all Thursday→Sunday weekend windows in **January and February 2026**.

The purpose is to identify **cost-saving opportunities** for peak summer weekend travel, with a focus on:
- Detecting significant price drops (≥10% day-over-day)
- Spotting when one-way equivalent fares drop below AUD $400
- Monitoring airline sales (especially Virgin Australia NZ Sale) and eligibility
- Flagging urgent booking opportunities when seat availability is low (≤5 seats remaining)

## Report Structure
Each daily report includes, for **each route × weekend window**:
- **Lowest Return Fare (AUD)**  
- **Airline**  
- **Cabin**  
- **Bag Policy**  
- **Number of Stops**  
- **Booking Link**  
- **Day-over-day change** (absolute and %)  
- **Savings vs baseline** fare range  
- **Sale eligibility** (Virgin NZ Sale: ✅ Eligible / ❌ Blackout / ⚠️ Limited Seats)  
- **Availability notes** (e.g., “only 3 seats left”)  
- **Flags:**  
  - **DEAL** – ≥10% price drop or one-way equivalent < AUD $400  
  - **BOOK NOW** – ≤5 seats at the displayed fare

3. Commit and push to keep a chronological archive of fare movements.

## Example Flags
- **DEAL:** Price dropped from A$560 to A$490 overnight (**–12.5%**) → flagged as DEAL.
- **BOOK NOW:** Fare shows “only 3 seats left” at A$455 return → flagged as BOOK NOW.

## Goal
